;; ;; ;;;; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
;; ;; ;;;; this above is difficult!!! 
;; ;; ;;;; We need to assert that consistent-state implies not out of bound!!
;; ;; ;;;; 
;; ;; ;;;; this will obilge us either change the next-inst to always to return
;; ;; ;;;; a wff-inst? 
;; ;; ;;;; ....
;; ;; ;;;;
;; ;; ;;;; Or introduce BCV into the consistent-state itself. 
;; ;; ;;;; 


;;;; this above is not right!! 
;;;; 
;;;; because we don't know that next-inst will be always within bounds!!! 
;;;;
;;;; We can only know that if we know that the consistent-state-strong 
;;;; asserts something more, such as consistent-state-bcv-on-track !!!! 
;;;;
;;;; Even in that case, we need to assert that very first frame
;;;; has a halt instruction for a state to be a consistent-state...  
;;;;

;;;
;;; Just to assert that one can legally invoke (next-inst st)!!! 
;;; and invoke (djvm-step (next-inst st)) 
;;;
;;; note this above skip-proofs is not true!!  because so far, we have not
;;; asserted wff-inst-strong for all instructions that contained in method
;;;
;;; We can only prove this, when we add all method "verified" to
;;; consistent-state
;;; 
;;; Our current BCV does not check assert wff-inst-strong, because it accepts
;;; more instructions!!! 
;;;
;;; Tue Oct 25 15:57:23 2005 As a result I need to write a simpler version of
;;; the BCV that only accept the limit number of instructions!! 
;;; 
;;;
;;; Shall I write a model of the BCV that function like tiny jvm's BCV??? 
;;;
;;; suppose this can be proved. by directly assserting consistent-state that
;;; all instructions in state is ...
