#; Adapted from makefiles for IHS and data-structures library, which were
#; created by Bishop Brock.

#; NOTE:  Target "all" causes a recursive invocation of make with ACL2 set to
#; its current value.  These recursive invocations of make thus have ACL2 set
#; on the command line, which overrides any values of ACL2 set in those files.
#; This should not cause any problems unless you try to do something fancy; see
#; the comment for example just above target .exercises.cert in
#; books/case-studies/ivy/ivy-v2/ivy-sources/Makefile from the ACL2
#; distribution.

# Success can be determined by checking for the absence of the following string
# in the log;  "**CERTIFICATION FAILED**".  The make process will stop as soon
# as certification fails unless the -k (or --keep_going) flag is specified (as
# per the GNU make manual).

#################### Editable variables ####################

# The default command below prints runtime statistics for the certification.
# We normally inhibit most output during certification to speed up the proofs.
# Edit as necessary.

# The setting of ACL2 immediately below reflects an assumption about where this
# Makefile will be executed, namely, directly under books/.  This assumption
# can of course be overridden by specifying ACL2 on the command line, for
# example: make ACL2=/home/smith/saved_acl2.  Be sure to do this override on
# the command line rather than by editing the line below, because that edit
# will probably not suffice for overriding the assignment of ACL2 that is made
# in some books (namely, those not just one level past books/).

ACL2 = ../../saved_acl2

# # Fix problem with sh on some Linux systems:
ifeq ($(OSTYPE),linux)
	SHELL = bash
 	ACL2 = ../../saved_acl2
endif
ifeq ($(OSTYPE),linux-gnu)
 	SHELL = bash
 	ACL2 = ../../saved_acl2
endif

# Inhibit all output except the summary (which can be useful for tracking down problems).
# Set this to "" if you do want the output.

INHIBIT = (assign inhibit-output-lst (list (quote prove) (quote proof-tree) (quote warning) (quote observation) (quote event)))

# Support for make dependencies:  should be a list of book names without
# the .lisp suffix.  Can be overridden on the command line or in a file
# that includes this file.

BOOKS =  $(patsubst %.lisp, %, $(wildcard *.lisp))

#################### END of editable variables ####################

# We should really check that following is not empty.  It is the same as
# books, but with .cert suffixes.  This variable should not be overridden;
# it is computed as needed from BOOKS.

BOOKS_CERT   = $(patsubst %, %.cert, $(BOOKS))
BOOKS_FASL   = $(patsubst %, %.fasl, $(BOOKS))

#  This tells make to expect `suffix rules' for these file suffixes.

.SUFFIXES: .cert .lisp

#  This rule tells how to get <book>.cert from <book>.lisp, either by running
#  ACL2 on the <book>.acl2 file (if it exists) or using the default command
#  to certify at ground zero.  Note that some Lisps execute (LP) upon startup
#  and some do not, and some (e.g., OpenMCL) might not even start in the ACL2
#  package, which can cause a problem if .acl2 files in our regressions suite
#  execute (LP) instead of (ACL2::LP).  We deal with these issues below.

# The dependencies rule prints make dependency commands to the screen.  The basic
# strategy is to look for include-book commands, and to prefix appropriately
# "$(ACL2_SRC_BOOKS)" when :dir :system is specified.  Thus, if :dir :system is
# specified then a common Makefile header in a books directory could be as
# follows (just strip off the leading "# " on each line).

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# # The following variable should represent the ACL2 source directory.
# # It is the only variable in this Makefile that may need to be edited.
# ACL2_SRC = ../../../../../..

# include $(ACL2_SRC_BOOKS)/Makefile-generic
# ACL2 = $(ACL2_SRC)/saved_acl2

# forms, as well as sed commands for modifying those include-book forms to
